# Anomaly_Detection_On_Transactions
Using Claude AI to teach me how to use unsupervised and reinforcement learning for identifying anomaly detection on bank transactions

Creating a comprehensive Python solution for detecting anomalies in bank transactions using multiple detection methods.
Bank Transaction Anomaly Detection

Let me explain the key components and features of this anomaly detection system:

**Detection Methods:**

Isolation Forest: Identifies outliers by random partitioning
Local Outlier Factor: Detects anomalies based on local density deviation
Autoencoder: Neural network that learns normal patterns
Statistical Analysis: Uses Z-scores and other statistical measures


**Feature Engineering:**

Temporal features (hour, day, weekend)
Transaction frequency metrics
Amount-based statistics
Account-level aggregations


**Risk Assessment:**

Combined scoring from multiple methods
Risk score calculation based on severity
Pattern analysis across different dimensions


**Analysis Capabilities:**

Transaction volume analysis
Temporal pattern detection
Account-level risk assessment
Merchant category analysis

To use this system with your own data:
pythonCopy# Load your transaction data
**transactions_df = pd.read_csv('your_transactions.csv')**

# Initialize detector
detector = TransactionAnomalyDetector()

# Prepare features
transactions_df = detector.prepare_features(transactions_df)

# Detect anomalies
results = detector.detect_anomalies(transactions_df)

# Analyze results
analysis = detector.analyze_anomalies(transactions_df, results)
Key Considerations for Bank Transaction Anomaly Detection:

**Data Quality:**

Ensure accurate timestamp data
Handle missing values appropriately
Normalize amount fields


**Performance Tuning:**

Adjust detection thresholds
Balance sensitivity vs. specificity
Consider computational resources


**Monitoring:**

Track false positive rates
Monitor detection performance
Update models regularly


**Customization:**

Add domain-specific features
Adjust thresholds for different account types
Implement custom rules for specific scenarios
